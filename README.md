# Improved-YOLOv8
In response to the problems of missed detection, false detection, and slow detection speed in surface defect detection of strip alloy material, this paper proposes an improved YOLOv8 based algorithm for surface defect detection of strip alloy material. Firstly, a Multiscale Feature Encoder (MFE) module is proposed, and a Feature Aggregation Diffusion (MFAD) structure is constructed in the neck to fully integrate the multiscale features extracted by the model backbone network, and the diffusion mechanism is used to spread features with rich contextual information to various scales. A Task Dynamic Alignment Detection Head (TDADH) with shared parameters is proposed, which reduces the number of parameters through shared parameters and works in conjunction with task alignment function to strengthen the association between classification and localization branches, thereby improving the detection accuracy of the model. Perceptual Attention Spatial Pyramid Pooling (PASPP) module is proposed, which models the spatial pyramid pooling by dynamically allocating high-dimensional features from both the channel and spatial dimensions, to prevent the loss of feature details caused by convolutional iteration and enhance the model's representation ability. Experimental results have shown that a 90.1\% mAP50 has been achieved on the surface defect dataset of our collected strip alloy materials, which is 6.3\% higher than the yolov8 network, with a 16.4\% reduction in parameter count and a detection speed of 232fps. Compared with current classic deep detection models, it has the highest detection accuracy and balances detection accuracy and speed well. At the same time, our algorithm also performs better on the surface defect dataset GC10-DET of strip steel and the general dataset PASCAL VOC2012.
